## Experiment Details

In this project, we utilize a DHT11 Temperature and Humidity sensor for real-time data acquisition. Here are some key details about the sensor:

- **Measurement Range:** 0 - 50 Degrees
- **Humidity Error:** ±5%
- **Temperature Error:** ±2%
- **Power Supply:** 3.3v - 5v

/Assignment: This experiment focuses on uploading sensor data,namely temperature & humidi from the DHT11 sensor to a Firebase Realtime Database using a Raspberry Pi.




## AI in project

Applying the Kalman filter to the sensor values to eliminate the anamolies in sensor readings.

#Working principle of the kalman filter:

The Kalman filter deals effectively with the uncertainty due to noisy sensor data and, to some extent, with random external factors. The Kalman filter produces an estimate of the state of the system as an average of the system's predicted state and of the new measurement using a weighted average.
